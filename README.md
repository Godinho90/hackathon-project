# Hackathon: Ice Cream e-Commerce app - Geladinhos Felizes

The final project at Academia de CÃ³digo was an exciting 24-hour Hackathon, centered around the theme of Disney Villains. Our team, consisting of myself, Diogo Carvalho, Luis Reis, Valter Oliveira, and Cristiano Esteves, came up with a concept for a fictional ice cream shop called Geladinhos Felizes.

Our idea was to create custom ice cream flavors infused with alcohol, inspired by the villains from the other participating groups. To add a touch of magic, each ice cream would contain a premonition, reminiscent of the fortune cookies, reflecting the unique "power" of Bruno, our chosen character.

The website we developed showcases the shop's menu, daily promotions, company information, and a convenient contact form. Throughout the project, we honed our JavaScript, HTML, and CSS skills, investing a lot of effort into the design aspects.

This team was amazing and worked really great!
We were immensely proud of the final result, and the project proved to be a fun and valuable experience that will benefit us in future endeavors.
